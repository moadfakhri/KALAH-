Discover more about the rules of the game on [this file](https://github.com/moadfakhri/KALAH-/blob/master/rules.txt) .

[Kawtar CHOUBARI](https://github.com/choub26) and I ( [Mouad FAKHRI](https://github.com/moadfakhri) ) have coded this game on C language with a graphic interface using SDL 2.0 .
The interface is shown on French as it was a school project for ENSIAS (National School of Applied Sciences in Rabat, Morocco).
